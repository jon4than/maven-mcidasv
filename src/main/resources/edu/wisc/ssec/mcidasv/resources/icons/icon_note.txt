Hello, and welcome to Icontopia. I've appointed myself petty dictator of icons.
Owing to the relatively large numbers of icons that we must deal with in McV,
I've created the following rules that should hopefully minimize headaches.

1) Always create a subfolder for your icons. Even if you're only using one icon.
   This makes isolating who is using what far easier.
2) If you'd like to borrow an icon from another subfolder, make a copy of it and
   place it in your subfolder. There's a little bit of overhead in that we might
   have to change an icon several times, but this way that isolation I talk about
   is maintained.

If these rules are violated I will probably not respond with military force, but
reserve the right to do so.
